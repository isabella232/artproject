  content:
    - 'Using high impact, immersive and interactive art, in conjunction with the underlying coding and computational workings happening in the Doge-ETH bridge, this project aims to foster community, participation and reflections around the pioneering work in the blockchain ecosystem.'
    - 'The art installation will be a traveling, penetrable sculpture that will provide an indoor and outdoor experience in the form of sounds, light and design. The surface of the installation will reflect the activity in the Doge-ETH bridge. The sculpture will be the space were creatives will realize their artistic vision.'

      - 'The starting point to conceptualize the public art structure is the Mobius bridge, designed by Hakes Associates of Bristol, UK. The bridge is abeautiful exploration of Mobius strips, providing a connection between point A and B while maintaining a single, unified surface.'
      - 'The Mobius strip leads to the construction of a very interesting solid called the Klein Bottle. Klein bottles, like the Mobius strip, have a unified surface. In addition, the Klein bottle provides an enclosed environment perfect for showcasing other artistic work using blockchains.' 
    lower:
      - 'The Decentralized Art Collective is born out of the necessity to collaborate with people from different fields required to navigate the convergence between art and blockchain. The #ArtProject aims to be a hub that brings together the people capable of unveiling, in profound and creative ways, what it might mean to live in a world where value itself has been reimagined, using the very tools that will make that possible, both to fund ourselves as a sustainable community and to create mind-blowing, heart-opening work.'
      - 'The Dogethereum bridge art structure will be the forerunner of a new generation of exciting creative projects, and the experimental platform for the creation of this Decentralized Art Collective, whose members are dynamic and whose vision is clear.'
