# #ArtProject

The #ArtProject is a collaboration between an amazing artist named Jessica Angel, the awesome team at Truebit, and Status (there may well be others to be announced in the not-so-distant future).

Imagined initially as a big physical piece meant to illustrate tangibly the Dogethereum bridge currently under construction at Truebit - this project is all about mapping into physical space the structures we are currently building in our new, decentralized digital worlds. We want to give people a visceral experience of digital space, to show them in a way that they can touch, feel, walk around and explore just why Ethereum and its ilk are so beautiful and exciting to those of us involved in actually fitting all the pieces of a new world together.

This project is about building and activating bridges: bridges between blockchains, bridges between digital space and meat space, between the virtual and the visceral, between the old and the new; bridges between human beings and the technologies we use to extend our capacities way beyond what most imagine to be the horizons of the possible.

You can find out more by watching the video below and joining the upcoming meetups and Makeathon that are mentioned!
